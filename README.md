### Digital Signal Processing (DSP) :

The Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course introduces the fundamentals of processing digital signals, a key technology in many fields such as telecommunications, audio processing, and radar. This course covers the theoretical foundations, practical techniques, and tools required to analyze, design, and implement digital signal processing systems.

Key Topics:
- Introduction to DSP: Overview of signal processing, comparison between analog and digital signals, applications of DSP.
- Discrete-Time Signals and Systems: Understanding discrete-time signals, linear time-invariant systems, and the Z-transform.
- Fourier Analysis: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and their applications in signal analysis.
- Filter Design: Design and implementation of digital filters, including Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters.
- Sampling and Reconstruction: Principles of signal sampling, Nyquist theorem, aliasing, and techniques for reconstructing signals from samples.
- Advanced Topics: Multirate signal processing, adaptive filtering, spectral estimation, and DSP algorithms in real-world applications.
